# RandomBoxAPI

The project is an API for a loot box and inventory management system. Users can register, log in, and perform various actions related to managing their inventories, obtaining items from boxes, buying and selling items, and accessing user-related information.

In this project, I worked with Entity Framework to configure its interaction with SQL databases, which was a key aspect of this project.

I learned how to set up the database context, define models and relationships, and perform various database operation with Entity Framework.

Next, I using the concept of repositories and services. These components played a important role on structure and logic for this project.

But let me tell you, the real challenge was connecting my API to the front-end part. Making them work together felt like solving a puzzle.

You can access the RandomBox web application by checking my github [HERE](https://github.com/slrlwtb2/RandomBoxWebApplication).
