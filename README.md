## RandomBoxAPI

In this project, I worked with Entity Framework to configure its interaction with SQL databases, which was a key aspect of the project.

I learned how to set up the database context, define models and relationships, and perform various database operations. It was fascinating to witness the power and flexibility that Entity Framework offers.

Next, I using the concept of repositories and services. These components played a crucial role in structuring and organizing my codebase by separating concerns.

But let me tell you, the real challenge was connecting my API to the front-end part. Making them work together felt like solving a puzzle.
